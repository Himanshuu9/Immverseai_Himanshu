# Active vs Passive Voice Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify sentences into **Active** or **Passive** voice using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model leverages various classification algorithms to detect sentence structure and determine the voice.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a text classification model that can accurately distinguish between active and passive voice sentences. The model processes input text, extracts relevant features, and classifies the text based on the voice detected.

Key Objectives:
- To preprocess and clean text data.
- To train and evaluate different machine learning models.
- To assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- To provide an explanation of the model's decision-making process (explainability).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and model training.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and testing.
